# Application of Finite Automata

**Project Name:** *AutomaQuiz:* A Sequential Quiz Game Using Finite State Machine (FSM)

**Description:** AutomaQuiz is a fun and interactive quiz game that uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control the game flow. Players answer multiple-choice questions related to automata theory. The game responds based on whether the playerâ€™s answer is correct or incorrect.

*Features:*
-	*Finite State Machine (FSM) Mechanics:* The game advances through questions (states) based on the player's answers.
-	*Three Lives:* Players start with 3 lives. Incorrect answers reduce lives, and the game ends when lives reach zero.
-	*Sequential Questions:* Players must answer each question in order, and only correct answers allow them to move to the next question.
-	*Endings:* The game ends with either a "Game Over" or "Perfect Score" message, depending on the player's performance.
